  9 (as of rn) blocks.
  Up to 9999 custom levels.

  Dash ability.

  Dash through walls if standing on block 9.

When using files, you must change the GLOBAL_PATH variable at the top of each .py file to the path.

Double backslashes _MUST_ be used, because python reads "\" as an escape character.

Have fun!
